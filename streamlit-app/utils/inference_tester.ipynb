Successfully complete the AUXCA program training: The specific training requirements may vary, so it's important to check with your local Auxiliary unit or District Staff Officer - Culinary Assistance (DSO-CA) for the most up-to-date information. The training may include courses and workshops related to culinary skills and sanitation.\n",
