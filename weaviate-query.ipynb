Flotilla \\nCommander \\nResponsibilities  Flotilla Commanders (FC\\u2019s) are responsible for the coordination of local activities. The FC is responsible to ensure program resources are made available to the Program Visitor at the proper times. This will necessitate \\nscheduling of VSC and public education program activities far enough in \\nadvance to make the information available to the Partner\\u2019s customers. A \\nRBSVP report should be included in the flotilla, division, and district meetings/ne wsletters, along with other staff and committee reports. The \\nFC should work closely with the leaders in the other flotillas in this coordination effort.  \\nA.5. FSO -PV The FSO -PV is directly responsible for the flotilla RBSVP and reports \\ndirectly to the FC and SO -PV. I n collaboration with their FSO -MA, they \\nmust keep their PVs supplied with the needed literature for distribution and inform them of new materials or changes in the program. They are also responsible for the proper reporting of new partners participants, number of partner visits made and any flotilla participation in the partner event.  \\nThe FSO -PV must evaluate the impact of the program upon the local area. \\nThey must also be attentive to possible over commitment and be ready to seek assistance from other flotillas if the situation dictates. Such requests for assistance should normally be coordinated at the division level.  \\n \\n \\n  \",\n",
